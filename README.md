Astley.js
=============
You know the rules! Astley.js is a sophisticated library that will transform all boring links into awesome ones.  No development site should go without it!

Compatibility
-------------
IE6+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera.  This script has been tested and is amazing cross browser. Astley.js also passes jslint so don't worry there!

Size
-------------
0.1k minified! So small that you wouldn't get this from any other guys.

Usage
-------------
So easy to use. Drop in a script tag before the end of your body.

``` html
<script src="js/astley.js"></script>
```

AMD
-------------
While astley.js is not itself an amd module you can load it with script loaders such as require.js.  Makes the prank even more diabolical.  And harder to trace.

``` html
require(["astley"], function() {
	// No commitment's what i'm thinking of...
});
```
